== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do this plugin require the Genesis Framework? =

This plugin is designed for sites running on the Genesis Framework. While you could successfully activate the plugin on a non-Genesis site, it is useless as the code relies on Genesis-specific actions.

= How do I know if the plugin is working? =

After activating the plugin, each word in your site title should be wrapped in a span tag.

= How can I style the title span tags? =

Add this your style.css in the section for your site title. Your class name may be different than .site-title so substitute as needed. 

.site-title span:nth-child(1) {
   add your styles here
}

Above example would target the first word in the site title. Change the number in parenthesis to target another word, span:nth-child(2) would target the second word, and so on.

.site-title span:nth-child(2) {
    color: #99d7da;
    font-weight: 600;
}

Above example would change the color and font weight of the second word.
